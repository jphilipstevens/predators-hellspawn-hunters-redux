# Predators Hellspawn Hunters Redux

A customized version of the **Predators Hellspawn Hunters** mod for GZDoom/Zandronum.

## About

This is my personal fork of the original Predators Hellspawn Hunters mod, created to experiment with gameplay changes and add features that suit my playstyle. All core mechanics and assets are from the original mod with modifications and enhancements.

## Original Mod Credit

**Original Mod:** Predators Hellspawn Hunters

This mod would not exist without jdredalert's excellent work. Please visit the original thread to show support and see the original version of the mod.

## Description

Predators Hellspawn Hunters is a gameplay mod that lets you play as a Predator (Yautja) from the Predator franchise. Hunt demons across the Doom universe with iconic Predator weapons and abilities including:

- **Cloaking Device** - Turn invisible to stalk your prey
- **Plasma Caster** - The iconic shoulder-mounted energy weapon
- **Wrist Blades** - Get up close and personal
- **Vision Modes** - Track your targets through walls
- And more weapons and gadgets from the films

## TODO - Planned Changes

Features and modifications I plan to implement:

1. **Optional Energy-Free Cloaking** - Add a setting to disable energy drain on the cloaking device for a more power fantasy-focused gameplay experience
2. **Movie-Accurate Cloak Dynamics** - Update the cloaking mechanics to more closely match the visual effects and behavior seen in the Predator films

## Installation

1. Make sure you have [GZDoom](https://zdoom.org/) or Zandronum installed
2. Download or clone this repository
3. Load the mod with your GZDoom-compatible IWAD (DOOM, DOOM2, etc.)

## License
